## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a data scientist in training with a background in biology and management, currently exploring machine learning, data-driven decision making, and time series forecasting.I love using data to solve real-world problems and bring ideas to life.

### ðŸ”­ Current Focus
I'm rebuilding the portfolio projects I completed during my data science bootcamp to sharpen my skills and share my work. These include:
- **SQL + Tableau** for data-driven business decisions  
- **Pandas + Matplotlib** for data storytelling  
- **A/B testing** using statistical analysis in Python  
- **Web scraping, APIs, and GCP** for data engineering  
- **K-Means Clustering & PCA** for unsupervised learning  
- **Regression & Classification models** (Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees, Logistic/Linear Regression)  
- **RAG-based Chatbot** using a Hugging Face inferential LLM  
- **Sales Forecasting App** with ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet and Streamlit
- 
### ðŸ’¡ Whatâ€™s Next
I'm working on making some of these projects public with clean code, documentation, and visualizations. I'm also practicing new techniques using public datasets and tutorials to deepen my skills. Stay tuned!
